title: 'Nowadays, what is Software Quality?'
date: 2020-02-24T19:03:16.768Z
description: >-
  Every single organization needs to acquire or create software pieces. It
  doesn't matter if itÂ´s a short integration package or a huge core system,
  everyone wants software quality. And I mean "want" as a synonym of desire,
  instead of a real understanding of what software quality truly is.

**The first inaccurate idea:**the software development process will guarantee quality. Well, it certainly can help, but what process are we talking about here? The management framework? The development process? I hear people saying: "Because we use[SCRUM](http://www.pslcorp.com/thought-leadership/blog/is-there-a-better-way-to-do-software.html)we can deliver better quality than a RUP project" Why? Maybe you can deliver products faster than when using[RUP](http://www.pslcorp.com/thought-leadership/blog/what-was-the-end-result-of-traditional-software-development-methodologies.html), but with the same quality issue (or even worse). Some vendors claim that using CMMI improves quality, and this might be true. But projects tend to cost more than necessary with the additional overhead needed to comply with CMMI practices. Even worse, sometimes an information government process, like ITIL, is perceived as a sufficient way to guarantee software quality.

## Summary

Nowadays, software quality could mean designing and testing solutions based on a well-defined set of quality attributes related to the customer specific needs. The costs of software quality will be associated to the time added to the construction effort to ensure every quality attribute needed is attained.

Quality in software depends on understanding what you need from the beginning, what the software quality attributes are and how to test each one in a fast and repeatable way. This is not going against agile approaches, but it needs experienced team members identifying what is needed and helping the customers make the right decisions.

This is an introduction to a series of articles describing and discussing each group of quality attributes according to ISO/IEC 25010 taxonomy
