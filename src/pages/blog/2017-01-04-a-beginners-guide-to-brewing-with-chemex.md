Software development outsourcing providers understand this and have formed many partnerships based on their ability to foster innovation. The best outsourcing partnerships are built on this foundation, with a working environment that makes room for experimentation, makes full use of the provider's technological expertise, and ultimately positions innovation as a key component of the engagement.

If you're looking to either build this foundation of innovation from scratch or strengthen your existing IT outsourcing projects, these best practices for fostering innovation should prove useful. 

In 1958, designers at the [Illinois Institute of Technology](https://www.spacefarm.digital) said that the Chemex Coffeemaker is _"one of the best-designed products of modern times"_, and so is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.

## Encourage Transparency and Communication 

As the client, it's your responsibility to empower your partner teams to bring their ideas forward and actively engage in the innovation process. Regular in-person visits can help with this, as can project kickoffs, ideation or road mapping workshops, and team-building activities. True creativity and innovation are only possible if everyone speaks up, so be sure to encourage a meritocracy of ideas from both sides of the partnership.

Transparency removes blockers to innovation, so ideally, your IT outsourcing partner should display a culture of openness and pro-activeness, both within their business engagements and internally. Extending this transparency throughout the outsourcing relationship will further support progressive innovation, so be sure to find partners and teams that you can trust.  

## Introduce Innovation Feedback Loops

Throughout the software development lifecycle, particularly in a DevOps or agile environment, there should be a system for efficient and consistent feedback loops involving all teams at all stages of the process, including development, data science, QA, operations, and any other project stakeholders. The same approach to feedback is essential for fostering innovation.

You and your software development outsourcing partner must work together to ensure you are constantly learning from your experiments and from each other. Innovation feedback loops are most beneficial for companies when they revolve around data, so consider using techniques such as monitoring, UX validations, demos, user acceptance testing (UAT), and so on, to validate your KPIs and help highlight areas where innovation could be adding the most value.
