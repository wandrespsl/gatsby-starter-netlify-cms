With its large pool of software engineering talent, high levels of English proficiency, convenient time zone alignment, and cultural affinity to the U.S. market, it's no wonder that Latin America has become a powerhouse in nearshore software development outsourcing over the last few decades.

However, these benefits alone will not support the industry forever, as the need for value-added services, emergence of next-gen technologies, and disruption from economic fluctuations will have more impact on customer buying decisions than ever before.

Since 1984, PSL has been on the front lines of the nearshore software development industry where we've witnessed the constant ebb and flow of trends throughout the sector. As we head into our 36th year of operations, here are the top five trends we expect to shape the nearshore market in 2020.

## Colombia Leads the Region

Next year, Latin America as a region is expected to benefit from several regulatory reforms put into place by authorities in 2019, improving the ease of doing business for foreign investors and nearshore development customers.

Colombia is leading the pack in this regard, with 37 reforms since 2005. Three of its major reforms this year made starting a business easier, simplified trading across borders and eased the process of resolving insolvency. The country has also remained on track to grow 3.4%, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), making it the highest earner in the region. In fact, this was the country's best rate of growth in five years, says the Financial Times.

Individual cities in Colombia are also investing in education and technology to improve the standard of living and drive consistent economic growth. Medellin is home to the fifth Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which was established to help strengthen the business sector, spur economic growth in the region, develop and support local talent, and address development challenges.

In order to attract the center in the first place, the city made an effort to increase the percentage of investment in science, technology and innovation from 0.7% of GDP in 2015 to 2.27% of GDP in 2018, a feat that has transformed the city and its people.

## Innovation, Innovation, Innovation

Creating new technologies and inventing digital solutions are common practices in the digital age, but one aspect of this brave new world still eludes some organizations: how to foster a culture of innovation.

True innovation should extend throughout a company from the top-down. It requires leaders who can champion a culture of innovation by empowering teams to experiment, work independently, and take responsibility for their own capabilities, all while supporting those efforts with a variety of different resources.

To aid with this innovation culture challenge, nearshore software development companies, particularly in Colombia, have been meeting U.S. clients head-on with their innovation efforts, positioning themselves as world-class innovation partners in several industries.

And while, it may seem counter-intuitive to outsource innovation, when you work with a nearshore development partner as a partner, innovation should become a natural extension of your partnership. But, also be on the lookout for opportunities to work with established leaders in software development outsourcing on PoCs or experimental projects where you are both trying to build up capacity in a new technology, methodology or more.

As more U.S. companies search for suitable partners that can facilitate new levels of innovation, we expect providers in the American nearshore to develop many more innovation partnerships during 2020.
